The provided code appears to be a Laravel PHP controller designed for a booking system. Below are some observations on what makes it okay and areas for potential improvement.
Base Controller for Consistent Responses: 
Consider creating a base controller class that extends Laravel's base controller and includes sendResponse and sendError methods for handling API responses in a generic and consistent way. By extending your controllers from this base class, you ensure that response handling is standardized across your application, making it easier to maintain and update.

Separate Different Responsibilities: 
The controller appears to do many things, such as user authentication, job handling, and email sending. Split these tasks into smaller, focused controllers or classes, so each component has a single, clear role.

Validate Incoming Data: 
Ensure that data from users is validated to match expected criteria. This helps prevent issues, especially when dealing with user input.

Use Configuration Files: 
Instead of directly referring to configuration values like adminemail in your code, utilize Laravel's configuration files. This approach is more organized and secure.

Minimize Code Repetition: 
Reduce repeating similar code, especially in the distanceFeed method. Consolidate similar if-else blocks to enhance code readability and maintainability.

Safely Handle User Authentication: 
Rather than directly accessing $request->__authenticatedUser, it's safer and clearer to use Laravel's built-in auth() or middleware for user authentication. This ensures that user authentication is handled consistently.
